# Space Engineers AutoHotKey Quick Load Script

Quickly load a script into a PB by training this where to click.  This is to speed up development.

## Installation

Download SE_quick_load_script.ahk and install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), then run the script.  It will show up as a systray icon and work in Space Engineers windowedfullscreen mode.  I haven't tested any of the other modes.

## Usage

The Shift+Alt+K hotkey combination will teach the script how to press buttons and what search strings to use to find your Programmable Block and your Script.  You can then use the Alt+K hotkey to quickly load it as you make changes saving you time in clicking over and over to test a change.

Why?  I got tired of opening the Terminal, finding my Programable block, clicking Edit, clicking BrowseScripts, clicking the script name, clicking Copy to Editor, clicking OK and then clearing the search box, whenever I made a code edit.  Now I just hit Alt+K.

  Shift+Alt+K  ->  While in SE Terminal it will prompt you to teach it the locations of buttons and search strings for PB and script
  Ctrl+Alt+K   ->  If you just want to reprogram the PB and Script name for searching.
  Alt+K        ->  In Terminal it will search for the PB and click buttons in sequence to search for and load script.
